## Problem Statement

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing Airbnb host data using SQL. The original dataset contains inconsistencies, null values, duplicates, and formatting issues that need to be resolved before the data can be used for analysis or reporting.

The cleaning process is performed entirely using SQL queries, showcasing best practices in data wrangling within a relational database environment.
